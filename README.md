# Interferometry_Visualizer
Interactive interferometric image simulator that demonstrates how telescope parameters affect the resolution of observing Earth from space. It displays two side-by-side canvases: the true image of Earth and a blurred "observed" image that mimics the limits of an interferometric telescope.
